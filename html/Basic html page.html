Shekhar from an Mudaliar family, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films. Rahman began studying piano at age four.<br>He assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.

                After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.<br><br>Raised by his mother, Kareema Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family. which led to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. Therefore, the Principal Mrs YGP summoned Rahman and his mother and told them that Rahman should focus on academics irrespective of family circumstances. Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year,and later joined Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, where he was admitted on his music talent and formed a band with his high school classmates.<br><br>However, after discussing with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician.Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and Raja)and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue.He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the "ideal combination of music and technology".
                
                Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj,and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan.

Viswanathan, Vijaya Bhaskar,Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu, Vijay Anand, Hamsalekha and Rajâ€“Koti,[25] accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar on world tours and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music.[16]

His mother was a practising Hindu. At the age of 23, he converted to Islam with other members of his family in 1989, changing his name to Allahrakha Rahman (A. R. Rahman).
